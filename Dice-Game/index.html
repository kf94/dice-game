          GAME RULES:<br><br>

          -The game has two players and is played round by round until either player reaches a score of 100.<br>
          -Each turn a player roles a dice, and they can role it as many times as they like.<br>
          -Each consecutive role is added to the current score.<br>
          -However If the player roles a one, their current score is set to 0, and they lose their turn.<br>
          -Once a player feels that they have reached the end of their luck, they can 'HOLD' to keep their current score and end their turn.<br>
