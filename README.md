GAME RULES:

-The game has two players and is played round by round until either player reaches a score of 100.
-Each turn a player roles a dice, and they can role it as many times as they like.
-Each consecutive role is added to the current score.
-However If the player roles a one, their current score is set to 0, and they lose their turn.
-Once a player feels that they have reached the end of their luck, they can 'HOLD' to keep their current score and end their turn.
